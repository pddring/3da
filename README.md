3D Assessment (3da)
===

Assessment is a crucial part of education. Students need to know where they're at so that they can know how they 
can improve. Parents need to know how their children are doing so that they can encourage and support their learning.
Teachers need to be able to give meaningful feedback to their students in a finite amount of time.

3D Assessment aims to give students, teachers and parents a meaningful measure of progress made up of 3 dimensions:
* Organisation: How much of a given project has a student completed?
* Understanding: How deeply does a student understand their work?
* Independence: How much support has a student been given?

3D Assessment is in the very eary development stage. Please see the Wiki page for further details:
