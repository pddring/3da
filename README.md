3D Assessment (3DA)
===

This is a work in progress and is currently just a placeholder until I find time to write up the thoughts behind the project.

It's designed to be a way of providing teachers with a quick and easy way to assess students' work in a way that gives meaningful information to students and parents (rather than just an arbitary number or letter).

It's designed with the UK 2014 Computing Curriculum in mind but the concepts could easily transfer to any other age range or subject area.
